	### Imagine This:

You have 5 apples, and they cost $10 in total. Now, you want to find out how much 8 apples would cost.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Find the Cost of One Apple:**
   - First, we need to know how much just one apple costs.
   - If 5 apples cost $10, then to find the cost of one apple, we divide $10 by 5.
   - So, $10 รท 5 = $2. This means one apple costs $2.

2. **Find the Cost of 8 Apples:**
   - Now that we know one apple costs $2, we can find out how much 8 apples cost.
   - We multiply the cost of one apple by 8.
   - So, $2 ร 8 = $16.

### Conclusion:

If one apple costs $2, then 8 apples will cost $16. 

This is the unitary method: first, find the cost of one item, and then use that to find the cost of more items. It's like solving a puzzle step by step!
